        <p>You wake to the low hum of the ship’s engines, a sound so constant it has woven itself into your dreams. Your bunk, narrow and firm, holds you steady despite the subtle tremors of the vessel cutting through the void. The air is sharp and synthetic, carrying the faint tang of recycled oxygen and the distant scent of machinery. You stretch, your joints protesting the artificial gravity, and for a moment, you wonder where you are.</p>
        <p>Then it hits you. The <em>Celestial Horizon</em>. Your assignment. The mission.</p>
        <p>The ceiling above you glows faintly, soft light panels mimicking a dawn that doesn’t exist out here. You reach for the console embedded in the wall, your fingertips brushing cool metal. The screen flickers to life, and the ship’s AI greets you in its clipped, precise voice.</p>
        <p>“Good morning, Commander. Time to destination: twelve hours, sixteen minutes. Current status: all systems nominal.”</p>
        <p>You sit up, your pulse quickening. Twelve hours until arrival at Kepler-442b, the first potentially habitable planet humanity has dared to approach. They chose you for this mission—for your resilience, your training, and maybe, just maybe, your willingness to leave everything behind.</p>
        <p>Through the narrow viewport beside your bunk, you see nothing but the void. No stars, no landmarks, just endless black punctuated by the faint glow of the ship’s running lights. It’s beautiful in a way that makes your chest ache.</p>
        <p>A chime pulls your attention back to the console. A new notification. <strong>Unscheduled maintenance required in Sector 3.</strong></p>
        <p>Your stomach tightens. You know the ship better than anyone—every panel, every wire. The <em>Horizon</em> doesn’t make mistakes. If something needs fixing, it’s because something has gone wrong.</p>
        <p>You swing your legs off the bunk, your boots finding the cool metal floor. The hum of the engines feels louder now, almost insistent. As you suit up, you can’t shake the feeling that the ship is alive, watching, waiting.</p>
        <p>The airlock to Sector 3 hisses open, and a rush of colder air greets you. The lights flicker once, twice, and you stop mid-step. You can’t remember the last time that happened.</p>
        <p>“AI,” you say aloud, your voice steady but firm. “Status update.”</p>
        <p>There’s a pause—a little too long for comfort. Then, the AI responds, its tone unchanged.</p>
        <p>“Sector 3 diagnostics indicate no anomalies. All systems are operational.”</p>
        <p>You frown. If there’s nothing wrong, then why are you here?</p>
        <p>The lights flicker again, and this time, you catch a shadow—something moving just beyond the edge of your vision.</p>
        <p>You freeze.</p>
        <p>“AI,” you whisper, your voice barely audible now. “Confirm lifeforms in Sector 3.”</p>
        <p>Another pause.</p>
        <p>“Lifeforms detected: one.”</p>
        <p>One. Just you.</p>
        <p>But you’re not so sure anymore.</p>
