        You wake to the low hum of the ship’s engines, a sound so constant it has woven itself into your dreams. Your bunk, narrow and firm, holds you steady despite the subtle tremors of the vessel cutting through the void. The air is sharp and synthetic, carrying the faint tang of recycled oxygen and the distant scent of machinery. You stretch, your joints protesting the artificial gravity, and for a moment, you wonder where you are.<br><br>Then it hits you. The <em>Celestial Horizon</em>. Your assignment. The mission.<br><br>The ceiling above you glows faintly, soft light panels mimicking a dawn that doesn’t exist out here. You reach for the console embedded in the wall, your fingertips brushing cool metal. The screen flickers to life, and the ship’s AI greets you in its clipped, precise voice.
