				You are Sir Cedric, the most valiant knight in the kingdom&#8212;well, at least according to your own boastful monologues. You stand before the castle gate, your sword gleaming in the sunlight, your armor as shiny as the day it was forged&#8212;though it's been a few years since it was polished, and there's a faint smell of something slightly off, like cheese. The guards are watching, but they aren't exactly trembling in fear. Instead, they seem...amused. Maybe it's the way you keep adjusting your helmet, which doesn't quite fit, or how youâ€™re slightly out of breath from your grand entrance. But you are here to rescue the princess, and nothing&#8212;nothing at all&#8212;can ruin this moment.</div>
